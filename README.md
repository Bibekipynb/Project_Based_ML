# Here I will be updating about the projects daily!

## Day 1

Today I completed chapter 1 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch (O'Reilly). I revised all the basic ML concepts, types of model, model selection, feature selection etc. This was just the thero part, explaining about supervised,semi-supervised,Unsupervised Learning etc.

And I have start building a project side by side, an EDA tool, which provides basic overview of the data, plots, suggestions of the data etc. I will keep updating as I update the features. As of today I have setup everything I need and I will be updating here from tommorow. Also, I will start chapter 2 from the ML Book.
